# Autonomous-Path-Planner

The Autonomous Path Planner program is a java application designed to allow the user to create Autonomous paths with only the drawing
of lines. It then also allows the user to export these files containing the Autonomous Paths to the robot as XML or CSV files.

The Autonomous Path Planner Source code is provided for other teams to use however they wish. I only included the source code so
the user has the freedom to use whatever IDE they wish
